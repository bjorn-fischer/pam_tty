# pam_tty.so
_Always a good idea: Replacing code with less code._
### What the module does
**chown(2)** ```/dev/ttyN``` on successful console login as a significantly less complex alternative to **systemd-logind(8)** or **elogind(8)**
### Rationale: Rootless X without complex seat managers
Everyone wants to run the xserver **Xorg(1)** as a normal user, i.e. without the suid bit set on the executable. But not everyone wants to deploy a full-featured seat manager aka login manager like **elogind(8)** or even **systemd-logind(8)** just for this. Fortunately most privileges needed for rootless X can be granted via Unix groups (_video, kvm, input,_ see below!). Except for the virtual console TTY devices ```/dev/ttyN```. One way to get around this would be putting the user into group _tty_ and configure the acting udev daemon to use ```rw-rw----``` for the virtual console TTYs, but this could be just too much security dealt for simplicity.

This is where **pam_tty.so** comes into play. **pam_tty.so** changes the ownership of the virtual console TTY device to the user on login, and back to the original value on logout. _Redhat™_ already had something similar (pam_console.so, much more complex than pam_tty.so) until the arrival of **systemd(1)**.
### Build and install pam_tty.so
You will need the usual build environment (compiler, make, etc) and PAM with header files, obviously. Then clone the repo or get and extract the ZIP archive and just hit ```make(1)```. And yes, "βελλεροφων" (=bellerophon) is the hostname of my computer — I did some experiments with IDNs one day and somehow it got stuck then.
```
[bf@βελλεροφων:~/src/pam_tty]$ make
gcc -O2 -Wall -fPIC -c pam_tty.c -o pam_tty.o
gcc -shared -o pam_tty.so pam_tty.o -lpam
[bf@βελλεροφων:~/src/pam_tty]$
```
Copy the ```pam_tty.so``` to the directory with the other PAM modules, e.g. ```/lib64/security/pam_tty.so```
### Configure and activate pam_tty.so
Most systems have a dedicated PAM stack for local logins. Just add it to the end as a **session** module. The only supported option is _debug_, just in case.
```
[bf@βελλεροφων:~/src]$ cat /etc/pam.d/system-local-login 
auth      include   system-login
account   include   system-login
password  include   system-login
session   include   system-login
session   optional  pam_tty.so
[bf@βελλεροφων:~/src]$
```

### What about Unix group _input_?

Good point. You definitely do **not** want to give every user unlimited access
to the Unix group **input**. Every user would have full control over all input
devices at any time (think of keyloggers or worse). The **logind** way of
solving this problem is to let logind open the devices for you based on some
policy (via dbus).

There are two options out of this. Either stay away from **libinput** and setup
your X11 input devices the old way. This also involves granting additional
privileges, probably. Or you limit access to group **input** to users who
are logged in on a virtual console TTY. There is even a pam module for this
already: **pam_group(8)**. You can set it up like pam_tty.so in your PAM
stack for local logins:
```
auth      include   system-login
account   include   system-login
password  include   system-login
session   include   system-login
auth      optional  pam_group.so
session   optional  pam_tty.so
```
You also need to set up the config file for pam_group.so:
```
#
# /etc/security/group.conf -- config for pam_group.so
#
login;tty*;*;Al0000-2400;input,audio,video
```
This way you also can manage other sensitive groups. Keep in mind that one
could log onto the console, and while being in the input group start some
processes, which do not necessariliy need to terminate on logout.

### Tips for starting rootless Xorg

After logging in at the virtual console, you probably want to start Xorg with
the options ```-keeptty``` and ```vtN``` where **N** is the number of your
virtual console:
```
startx -- -keeptty vt`tty | sed 's/.*tty//'`
```
or, if you do not want Xauthority handled by startx:
```
xinit -- -keeptty vt`tty | sed 's/.*tty//'`
```
